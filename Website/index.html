<h1> About Us </h1>
<p> For the longest i can remember i always had a passion to reach out to other disability people like myself. I first start going to the special olympics when i was in my 10th grade in high school the first event i went to was the snow. I'm not going lie i enjoy myself very much that day I even made a bestfriend that day his name is Devonta we just hit it off right away. All the stuff that was there thought we was brothers they also and us to do a little stand up because we was alway joking around every chance we got. We both look at each other and said what we going talk about so one stuff said just go up there and just start talking about anything so we did. At the end of the night everyone wanted to hung out with us. We both did'nt mind because the more marryer. So since that day i alway had this image to develop a website for disability people to stay in contect and do things </p>
