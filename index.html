	<h1>About me</h1>

	<p>My name is Henry Vercher I want to become a computer technician. I had a little bump along the way. Bit i'm a fighter i never give up on what i started. by saying that here my little story. I first got started with computer when i was in 7th grade since then I was stuck with it. When i turn 24 I went web search for a good school to go to so i can learn more about computers. The school i came cross was Heald College i was there for two years. doing the year in half i was there and coming up toward the time for me to graduating the school was going underground. So i didn't get a chance to finish. The one thing i didn't like was the big fat loan to pay off. So now i'm going to Fresno City College for the same major. </p>
